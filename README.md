# Lancs LRU

A Least-Recently-Used cache implementation and example HTTP server created to
demonstrate the Go programming language to students at Lancaster University. 

To learn more about Go, check out the resources at https://go.dev/learn/!

> This package is for demonstration only and DOES NOT fully implement an LRU
> cache. Consider or cloning this repo and making it work it yourself. The TODOs
> should hint at what's left to do - and the tests will all pass once 
> implemented.
> 
> To see an implementation that actually works, check out my PokÃ©API client 
> package at https://github.com/nightmarlin/pokeapi
